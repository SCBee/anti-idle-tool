# anti-idle-tool

### Information

This tool is useful for those that need to stop their computers (or apps) from idling, sleeping, or turning the screen off but cannot change the settings to do so. It was built in C++ using multithreading. It has a very low RAM and disk space footprint, and can be configured easily through the CLI prompts!

### What did I learn?

I learned some neat stuff about multithreading and how useful it can be for applications that require multiple tasks to be handled separately. I enjoyed using the <thread> STL library and will try to study it for more complex solutions.
